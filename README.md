    git clone https://github.com/theskyspace/curioquest.git
    cd curioquest
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Configure environment variables:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
        ```plaintext
        BING_API_KEY=your_bing_api_key
        COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key
        ```

### Deployment

#### Vercel Deployment
1. Set up a Vercel account and link the project repository.
2. Configure the environment variables in Vercel:
    - `BING_API_KEY`
    - `COHERE_API_KEY`
3. Deploy the application by following the Vercel dashboard prompts.
4. Access the deployed application via the generated Vercel URL.

### Usage

#### Main Features
1. **Query Input**: Users can type in any question to initiate a search.
2. **Follow-Up Questions**: After receiving an initial response, users can ask follow-up questions to refine the context or request additional information.
3. **Source-Cited Answers**: Every response includes references to sources, which can be viewed by hovering over the citations.

#### Example Interactions
1. **Ask a Question**:
    - User: "Who is Elon Musk?"
    - CurioQuest: Returns a detailed answer with citations from Bing Search.
2. **Follow-Up Questions**:
    - User: "What are his companies?"
    - CurioQuest: Uses the previous context to provide an updated answer with sources.

### Design Decisions


#### 1. Why Bing?
When selecting a search API, we evaluated major options like Google, X, and Bing. After weighing our choices, Bing emerged as the clear winner. Here‚Äôs why:

- **Trustworthy Source**: Platforms like Perplexity also rely on Bing, indicating it‚Äôs a trusted source for accurate, structured, and real-time data.
- **Seamless Integration**: Bing‚Äôs API integrates smoothly, enabling us to deliver fast, reliable answers without technical bottlenecks.
- **Reliable and Up-to-Date**: Bing excels at providing the latest information, aligning perfectly with our goal of offering timely, verifiable responses.

- [Reddit on Perplexity‚Äôs Backend](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1bcq8zy/d_can_someone_please_clarify_if_web_search_llms/)
<br>

#### 2. Cohere AI for Answer Generation
The decision to use Cohere AI for generating responses was driven by both practicality and budget optimization. While premium models like GPT were appealing, Cohere offered a cost-effective solution that still delivers high-quality, contextually accurate answers.  
*Maybe someday, if I land a role with a bigger budget, we can go ‚Äúbroke-free‚Äù and integrate the premium models‚Äîbut until then, Cohere is a solid choice!* üòÖ
<br>

#### 3. Streamlined UI
The UI is designed with a minimalist layout to enhance content focus, and citation bubbles offer quick access to sources for easy reference.
<br>

#### 4. Why I Chose Next.js
- **Time Crunch and UI Focus**: With limited time, Next.js was ideal for building a sleek, responsive UI that offers seamless functionality. Its SSR and file-based routing simplified a lot of front-end work.
- **Perfect Fit for MVP**: As an MVP with minimal backend requirements, Next.js made sense as a front-end-first framework that‚Äôs easy to scale if needed.
- **New Territory**: Initially, I was a bit skeptical since I hadn‚Äôt worked with Next.js extensively. However, its developer-friendly setup and extensive ecosystem made it manageable and a solid choice for tight deadlines and feature-rich UIs.
<br>

#### 5. Separation of Context and AI Generation APIs
- Due to Next.js function call limitations on the free tier, we opted to separate the context-gathering and AI generation functionalities into distinct APIs. This approach allowed us to manage call frequency more efficiently while staying within free-tier constraints. By isolating these services, we could ensure smoother performance and flexibility, especially as demands for either context or AI-driven responses evolve with project scaling.
