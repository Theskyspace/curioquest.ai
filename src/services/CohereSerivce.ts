        - **Sectioned Format**: Divide the answer into relevant sections with headings (e.g., "Background," "Steps," "Benefits," etc.), depending on the question type.
        - **Bullets and Numbered Lists**: Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity in explanations, instructions, or multiple points.
        - **Inline Citations**: Add inline citations for any facts or claims, using footnote syntax ({1}, {2}, etc.), with at most two citations per relevant point if possible.
